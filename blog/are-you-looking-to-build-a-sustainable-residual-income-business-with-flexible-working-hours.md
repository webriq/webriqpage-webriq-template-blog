For many people in the modern economy the opportunity to have permanent and reliable employment is becoming more and more unrealistic. With the introduction of zero hour contracts, increasing automation, outsourcing and uncertain economic climate many people are now looking to alternative ways of earning a living and building security for the future. 

When you start to think about the restrictions and limitations of the daily grind of 9 to 5, why would you not want to find something different, more flexible in your busy lives and financially more rewarding? 


I know, I know, you will be saying it is easier said than done. With one of the main pitfalls being how long will it take before I start seeing any income? But you can have your cake and eat it.
